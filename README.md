  🤖 lemon.markets Telegram Bot

> Note: This is not an official [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets) bot. Please only use this as a starting point or reference for your own projects. 

## 🚀 What can it do? 


This Telegram bot is provided by lemon.markets to showcase one of the many use-cases of the API. This bot can be used to place trades on your own lemon.markets
account and gain an overview of your portfolio. The available commands are: `/start`, `/trade`, `/quicktrade`, `/portfolio` and `/moon`.

## 🛠️ Getting Set-Up


This repository requires the creation of an `.env` file with the following variables to communicate with the lemon.markets API: `MIC`, 
`TRADING_URL`, `MARKET_URL` and `AUTH_URL`. It also needs a `BOT_TOKEN` to communicate with the Telegram API.

### 🍋 lemon.markets

There are three lemon.markets API URLs, the first one is related to authentication (as all requests need an access token), the second to trading and the third
to market data. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.lemon.markets) to learn more and find the appropriate URLs. 

### 📞 Telegram

To connect to the Telegram API, you must obtain an access token by setting up a new bot via @BotFather. Read [this guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
to find out how.
